Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    An inline element only takes up as much space as the element needs, a block element takes up the whole width of the screen regardless of its size.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    When an element is positioned absolutely it no longer takes up a space, meaning other items around it interact as if it wasn't there.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    You change the display property of the element to inline-block.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Three elements that are display block by default:
            1. <h1>
            2. <p>
            3. <nav>
        Two elements that are display inline by default:
            1. <span>
            2. <a>
        One element that is display inline-block by default:

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model is how elements take up space on a webpage. All elements are put into "boxes" that contain the content, padding, border, and margin. We fix the box model by setting all default styling provided by the browser to zero. So that any widths we give the elements are respected.
